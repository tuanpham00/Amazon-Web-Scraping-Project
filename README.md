# Amazon-Web-Scraping-Project
Amazon Web Scraping Using Python
This project aims to build a Python-based Amazon price tracking system that automatically collects product information (title, price, date), and stores it in a CSV file.

Why automate price monitoring instead of checking manually?
- Prices on e-commerce platforms change frequently
- Manual checking is time-consuming and inefficient
- Automation allows continuous monitoring with minimal human effort

Why I use web scraping for this project?
- E-commerce platforms display prices publicly
- Not all platforms provide free APIs
- Web scraping allows data extraction directly from web pages
